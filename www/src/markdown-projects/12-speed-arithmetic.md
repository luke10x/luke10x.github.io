Practice Speed Arithmetic by excersizing your brain.
Originally, I wanted to write a simple app for kids to learn basic arithmetics.
So I wrote this app, but while testing it
turned out that it helped myself, to become extremely fast in calcultions.
And I noticed that any my daily ativites involving calculations became so much easier.
Because I improved my brain!
Now for example whicle counting money, I feel much more relaxed,
because it does not give no mental stretch for me to do those simple operations.
I estimate that my overal skill of basic arithmetic increased x10!

So friends, this app is not for kids anymore, but for general public.
(Or course the litle ones can also make use of it,
which will make real math champions at school).
