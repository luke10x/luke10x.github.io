This project is designed to help people working with OAuth to understand how certain authentication flows work and to provide a platform for testing their own applications. By using the OAuth Testbed, users can gain a deeper understanding of OAuth, ensuring their applications are secure and functioning correctly.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
